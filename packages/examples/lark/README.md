# lark

This package is used in development to test the interface generation
of [`dartpip`](../../dartpip/README.md).

More specifically, this package tests the generation of Dart interfaces from python packages that
have many source files. [`lark`](https://pypi.org/project/lark/) is a good example of such a
package.
