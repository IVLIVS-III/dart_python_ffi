# transitive_dependencies_test_flutter

This package is used in development to test the interface generation
of [`dartpip`](../../dartpip/README.md).

More specifically, this package tests the generation of Dart interfaces from python packages that
require other python packages, i.e. transitive dependencies to be handled as well.
