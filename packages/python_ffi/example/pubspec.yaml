# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - python-modules/python_ffi.py
    - python-modules/modules.json
    - python-modules/liblax/__init__.py
    - python-modules/liblax/core.py
    - python-modules/liblax/parser.py
    - python-modules/liblax/LICENSE.txt
    - python-modules/json_parser/__init__.py
    - python-modules/json_parser/parser.py
    - python-modules/json_parser/lexer.py
    - python-modules/json_parser/LICENSE.txt
    - python-modules/type_mappings.py
    - python-modules/structs.py
    - python-modules/primitives.py
    - python-modules/hello_world.py
    - python-modules/data_class.py
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
